My name is F. Allen Barker aka NeoCrypter on YouTube and most social media. I am a content creator that loves to create tutorials, reviews and gaming video content. some of my favorite things is learning new ways to make content including,

- new technologies
- new software
- creative ways to do things
- using open source software where I can

So then, what can you expect from my main channel? I try to produce gaming related and youtube related videos such as lets plays, gaming tutorials, equipment reviews when I am able, as well as other nifty content that I hope people find useful. I love to teach people how to do new things and I am a firm believer in the old saying “knowledge is power” and because of that I am always studying new things mostly to do with content creation and youtube, as well as a little quantum physics here and there.

Over the years I have been able to work with a few different companies from game developers to hardware manufacturers to produce videos over their products, some noteworthy companies are.

- Nova Quark creators of Dual Universe
- Wild Card Studios Creators of Ark: Survival Evolved
- Ego Soft creators of the X series of games
- G-Portal Game hosting service
- FiFIne a microphone company
- Elgato Creator of many different gadgets related to streaming

When it comes to paid video creation e.g. if a company wants me to produce a video, or add in a segment into a video talking about their service or product I will not recommend something that I don't use or play myself, Yes there will be no Raid Shadow Legends segments on my videos I’ve actually turned them down twice.
