## Lets talk about Linux

So I have been tinkering with linux for about a decade. I have always loved how flexible it was great for new hardware or old hardware, it really shines when you have a decade old dual core laptop with only 4gb of ram laying about and you decide to install linux to it, Seriously I have an old gateway that lags under Windows 8 because of how poorly Windows manages resources, under Garuda Linux which is a Distro based off Arch Linux it's snappy and runs smoothly. As for my main production machine I keep switching to linux for a few months here and there and then end up back on windows. It is mostly because of my video card. See for windows Nvidia Graphics cards great which is what I have an RTX 2060, but under linux your experience might vary a bit as Nvidia Drivers are not the best. In fact I have lots of troubles with getting some games to work, using newer technology such as Wayland all because of bad Nvidia support.
 
AMD graphics cards however are superb on linux; there are the proprietary drivers, as well as Open Source drivers that allow linux developers to more easily write for those types of cards. This however is my pigeonhole to be able to switch to linux full time. I need to replace my RTX 2060 otherwise I will just end up coming back to windows over and over.
