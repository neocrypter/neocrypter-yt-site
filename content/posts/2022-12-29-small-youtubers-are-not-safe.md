# Even small content creators are at risk.

<p> Over the past several months I have recived a number of emails to my YouTube contact email that claim to be promoters for various companies, Nord VPN, Topaz Labs, Endlight Games. At First I dissmissed it as just a random occurence but as the months went on I started reciving more and more of them. So I started looking a little deeper into it and I've discoved I am not the only small content creator that this has been happening too.
