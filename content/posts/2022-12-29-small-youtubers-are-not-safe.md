# Even small content creators are at risk.

<p> Over the past several months I have recived a number of emails to my YouTube contact email that claim to be promoters for various companies, Nord VPN, Topaz Labs, Endlight Games. At First I dissmissed it as just a random occurence but as the months went on I started reciving more and more of them. So I started looking a little deeper into it and I've discoved I am not the only small content creator that this has been happening too.

<p> I will admit most of these emails I peged as fake even though they were very well composed and did not directly ask me any information that could comprimise the security of my account, on the contrary they asked relavent information such as how much I charged for a 90 second segment of time in my videos, but if I am being honest the biggest tell for me was the fact that most of these companies would not give my little channel the time of day such as Nord VPN for example I know my channel is too small and my analytics are not up to snuff to attract a company such as that.

<p> The one that almost got me was the one that appeared to be from Endlight Games wanting me to promote the upcomming game Sons of the Forest which in all honesty had me a little excited as that is a game I am looking forward too. After the inital dopamine surge wore off though I started looking closer at the email and noticed that the email address seemed off, So I did a whois search on the domain and infact all the domains of the wouldbe phishers and discovered a trend they are all comming from a registar in russia, all of the contact snail mail adresses were either in or near Moscow.
