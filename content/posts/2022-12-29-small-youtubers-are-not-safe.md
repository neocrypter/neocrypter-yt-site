## Even small content creators are at risk.

<p> Over the past several months I have received a number of emails to my YouTube contact email that claim to be promoters for various companies, Nord VPN, Topaz Labs, Endlight Games. At First I dismissed it as just a random occurrence but as the months went on I started receiving more and more of them. So I started looking a little deeper into it and I've discovered I am not the only small content creator that this has been happening too.
 
<p> I will admit most of these emails I pegged as fake even though they were very well composed and did not directly ask me any information that could compromise the security of my account, on the contrary they asked relevant information such as how much I charged for a 90 second segment of time in my videos, but if I am being honest the biggest tell for me was the fact that most of these companies would not give my little channel the time of day such as Nord VPN for example I know my channel is too small and my analytics are not up to snuff to attract a company such as that.
 
<p> The one that almost got me was the one that appeared to be from Endlight Games wanting me to promote the upcoming game Sons of the Forest which in all honesty had me a little excited as that is a game I am looking forward too. After the initial dopamine surge wore off though I started looking closer at the email and noticed that the email address seemed off, So I did a whois search on the domain and in fact all the domains of the would be phishers and discovered a trend they are all coming from a registrar in russia, all of the contact snail mail addresses were either in or near Moscow.
 
#### What you can do to protect yourself
 
This is going to seem pretty obvious to some, but to others maybe this advice will help you to stay safe.
The easiest way to protect yourself is to be skeptical and pay attention to the email address and I mean really look at it. Most of the time these addresses looked reasonable other than they would have something like @nordvpn-business.com. Basically a prefix or suffix than a hyphen <hr />

In  other cases sometimes it's not as noticeable, but being skeptical can go a long way to keep you safe for example as I mentioned with the supposed email from the creators of the Sons of the Forest I ran a whois registrar search to learn about the domain which was only created a few days before I received the email and had some shady registrar information.  <hr>

To Look up this information I used https://www.whois.com/whois/ you can type in any domain name and learn a lot of information about the site.
 
<p> Beyond that if you are still unsure about an email, get the opinion of someone you trust, we are all in this together after all and we all know at least a few other creators that we talk to discuss it with your peers and ask for their thoughts on the email.
